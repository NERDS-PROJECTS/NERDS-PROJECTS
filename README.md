# NERDS-PROJECTS

<b><i>"An artist captures the world, an engineer moulds it"</i></b>

A Robotics Engineer, on the other hand, moulds living art. A beautiful synthesis of ingenuity, skill and vision, robotics arms you with the tools to make your life easier, create augmentations for benefit, upgrade your arsenal of mundane items, or maybe even to build yourself a robot army! The Robotics Club is an open playground for enthusiasts, guided upgrade for beginners, and a comprehensive lab for tinkering veterans. Yonder you will find destructive diminutive combots, intelligent integrated explorers, handsome handshake machines, daring drones and even…coffee dispensers!

Join us at the Robotics Club, and be part of a tactile and incredibly fun mechatronic movement that promises to both make and have you make exciting machines of the future. All our tools are at your disposal, Engineer, and we’re ready to kick this off. Scout’s honour.
